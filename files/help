Bad Apple Help
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This demo uses OSWORD &7F to read sectors directly from the disc,
this is necessary for speed. Therefore the disc image must be kept intact
- do not copy the files, it won't work!

This demo was designed to be run from a genuine 80T double-sided floppy disc!
The disc must be in drives 0 and 2, sorry but it is hard coded this way.
It is recommended that you disable any Tube interfaces.

For RetroClinic DataCentre:
Load the .DSD disc image into two RAM drives using the *IMPORT -02 <fsp> command
You must issue the *DTRAP command before !BOOT'ing from the RAM drive.

For MMC devices:
You will need two separate .SSD images added to your MMB file.
Load the images into drives 0 and 2 using the following commands:
*DR.0
*DIN <disk #1>
*DR2.
*DIN <disk #2>
